    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Items left behind by former Japanese soldiers in many battlefields throughout Asia and
        in the Aleutian Islands were discovered and brought home by U.S. and allied soldiers as
        souvenirs at the conclusion of WWII in the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of these items have been collected by Yasuhiko Kaji, MD, a Japanese doctor
        living in Ohio, USA. Dr. Kaji started purchasing Japanese war memorabilia with his own
        funds in 1971 and returned them to their original owners and families in Japan for five
        decades.</p>
        <p>In support of his humanitarian service, Project “Returned Memories Kiseki” was started
        as a nonprofit organization. There are many artifacts in our collection for which we are
        still seeking the original owner’s families or descendants. Any help in identifying these
        relatives would be appreciated. Kiseki continues to purchase returnable WWII artifacts
        and attempts to repatriate them to rightful owners.</p>
        <p>If you possess such items and would like to donate them towards this effort, please
        send us pictures and detailed information about them.  We will be happy to assist you in
        locating their rightful owners. The family search service is at no cost to you, and the
        artifacts will not be collected until the original owners are identified and their families are
        found. We would ask for your assistance in this endeavor to “let war memorabilia come
        home.”</p>
        <p>If you have any information or inquiries about the war memorabilia, please contact us at
        the following email address:</p>

        <p>[* Kiseki means "miracle" in Japanese (奇跡)]</p>
